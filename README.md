Prompt:  Find something thatâ€™s connected to the Internet in an insecure fashion and commit a picture to your Github

I use Skype all the time to communicate with my friends and family. While we sometimes message each other, the webcam is utlized in almost all conversations. I wonder how secure our conversations are since communication is via the Internet; plus the service is free of charge. It's scary to think that maybe you're sharing a private moment with your loved ones, but actually the world can see everything. For example, this picture promoting Skype usage:

I also use iMessages for texting a lot. I also wonder how secure these messages are. And if I take the precaution of deleting a message, does that message actually cease to exist, or is it similar to the iCloud situation, where it just gets stored in a "deleted folder" somewhere on the Internet. 

Deep Thoughts by Danielle Coulter:

As I wondered which electronic device in my home could make me most vunerable to hacking (for me it would be an electronic doggy door) the instantly terrifying thought I had was, "What if it's the home security system itself." Disbelief insued when I discovered an article posted just two weeks ago on the website: Dark Matters, Superior Attack Intelligence. They reported on the ongoing research projects at Hewlett-Packard Enterprises. Ultimatley, they found, "10/10 systems were vulnerable to account harvesting via the cloud interface." Their research explores the safeguards that come standard in home security systems to include: password strength (weak passwords are accepted instead of being rejected) and "lock out defense" (some will not execute the system to lock down when being tampered with).  But perhaps most shocking, HP reports that 7/10 of securtiy systems failed to utilize authentication "protocols." This is to say that the system didn't even verify they were using their own, safe, server. Even Twitter does that. Remember? You pay for that service with the ~50 characters remaining after your alloted 140 character tweet.

Every time I turn my car on, an image pops up on my screen.

By accepting that Nissan takes data from my car, I realize that this could be any data. I already know that Nissan will add a new charging station on my map if I charge in a place they were unaware existed before. However, there is a lot more data than that, that I am sure they are also tracking. They are likely tracking, at the very least could track, where I am driving and when I drive my car. As soon as I hit the "OK" button, they know that I have started driving. So they are able to know when I leave for school, work, etc.
