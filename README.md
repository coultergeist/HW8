Prompt:  Find something thatâ€™s connected to the Internet in an insecure fashion and commit a picture to your Github

I use Skype all the time to communicate with my friends and family. While we sometimes message each other, the webcam is utlized in almost all conversations. I wonder how secure our conversations are since communication is via the Internet; plus the service is free of charge. It's scary to think that maybe you're sharing a private moment with your loved ones, but actually the world can see everything. For example, this picture promoting Skype usage:

I also use iMessages for texting a lot. I also wonder how secure these messages are. And if I take the precaution of deleting a message, does that message actually cease to exist, or is it similar to the iCloud situation, where it just gets stored in a "deleted folder" somewhere on the Internet.
